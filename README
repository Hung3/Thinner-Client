This project implements an STM32F based thin client which can send and receive data over serial, read a keyboard, and display the contents of a 480x240 framebuffer on an NTSC television.

The included main.c implements a vt100 serial terminal with 80x24 characters.

xvsmfbg stands for X virtual shared memory frame buffer grabber. It is designed to grab frames from Xvfb, and spit them at a fixed rate to stout. 

You can use it to send frames from your computer to a thinner client and display them on a TV.  The code to implement this is not currently in this repo, but it should be pretty simple to write - just read stuff out of the serial buffer and put into the frame buffer.
