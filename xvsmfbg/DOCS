xvsmfbg: X virtual shared memory frame buffer grabber

xvsmfbg is designed to grab frames from Xvfb, and spit them at a fixed rate to stdout.

Typical compilation:

	g++ xvsmfbg.cpp -o xvsmfbg

Typical invocation:

	Xvfb :1 -screen 0 480x240x8 -shmem | ./xvsmfbg | somewhere

To test out xvsmfbg without an actual serial port, compile the code in emulator/, then run:

	Xvfb :1 -screen 0 480x240x8 -shmem | ./xvsmfbg | emulator/tc_emulator
	DISPLAY=:1 mplayer -fs some_video.m4a

... Or anything else that will use an x server.

If you are on a fresh Ubuntu (or equivalent Debian) install, you will need the following packages to compile stuff:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl-dev

All makefiles included should work file for compilation.
